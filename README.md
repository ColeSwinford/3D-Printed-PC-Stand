# 3D-Printed-PC-Stand
3D printed stand for ATX/Mid-tower cases

## Dimensions of stand (x, y, z)
(9, 18, 3) inches

## Dimensions of fasteners (x, y, z)
(2.75, 2.75, 0.75) inches

## Hole diameter
6.25mm, which is enough tolerance for a M6 (6mm) bolt to slot through tightly when printing with PLA

## Other materials
8 M6x50.0mm bolts
8 M6 washers
8 M6 nuts

## Printing notes
This design is strong enough to be printed at just 10% infill with a grid pattern, so very time/fillament efficient. I have tested this design with up to a 40 pound desktop (steel case, full of heavy components) with minimal flexing around where the case feet touch the stand. If this makes you uncormfotable, 20% infill should resolve this.
